# DS - A Deductive System

A deductive system for logical inference, implemented in C++. The library provides bindings for Python (via pybind11) and TypeScript/JavaScript (via Emscripten/WebAssembly).

## Features

- **Multi-Language Support**: Use the same deductive system in C++, Python, or TypeScript/JavaScript
- **Logical Terms**: Work with variables, items (constants/functors), and lists
- **Rule-Based Inference**: Define rules and facts, perform logical deduction
- **Unification and Matching**: Unify terms and match rules
- **Search Engine**: Built-in search mechanism for iterative inference
- **WebAssembly**: Run inference in the browser or Node.js environments
- **Type-Safe**: Strong typing support in TypeScript and Python
